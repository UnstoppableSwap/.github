# UnstoppableSwap
This is UnstoppableSwap, the anonymous, trustless and secure software for Bitcoin <-> Monero atomic swaps. 

In this organization we host multiple repositories which contain all the open source code for our different subprojects:

 - In [`xmr-btc-swap`](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/xmr-btc-swap) we maintain a monorepo which contains the rust binaries as well as our graphical user interface
 - In [`unstoppableswap-docs`](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/unstoppableswap-docs) we write documentation for our [docs page](https://docs.unstoppableswap.net) about atomic swaps in general as well as our software
 - In [`asb-docker-compose`](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/asb-docker-compose) we provide accessable docker images for those interested in running a swap provider service
